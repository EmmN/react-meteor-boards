# react-meteor-boards
A simple board build with react and meteor.
This is just a test app to see what I can do with React + Meteor

# Things done

- coffescript + JSX
- integrate Blaze templates in React components (accounts-ui)
- router
- drag and drop with jQueryUI (vertical and horizontal scroll fixes)
- three way binding on input / textarea (not sure it's a good solution)

# Demo
